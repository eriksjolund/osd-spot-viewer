TODO:

Create a web project that will make use of
https://github.com/eriksjolund/OpenSeadragonPaperjsOverlay
to be able to draw objects (e.g. circles) in different colors
on an OpenSeadragon window. The objects should be selectable
with mouse lasso. The selected objects should also be draggable.


Demo:
Drag some circles with the mouse:
